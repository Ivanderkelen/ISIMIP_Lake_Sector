# Python scripts to create netcdf files from raster files for ISIMIP3 global lake sector input

The main script is [write_netcdf_isimip_inputs.py](./write_netcdf_isimip_inputs.py) and uses [functions.py](./functions.py)

### Python packages needed to run the script
The list of python packages can be found in [isimip_lakes_env.yml](./isimip_lakes_env.yml) and can be installed using conda as described [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file).
