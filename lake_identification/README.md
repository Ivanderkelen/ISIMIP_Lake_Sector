To make the main code work (Calculate_lakedepth_v2.R) you must download the only input needed, HydroLAKES v1.0 "Lake polygons" in shapefile format. This is downloable from the [HydroLAKES webpage](https://www.hydrosheds.org/page/hydrolakes).
After changing the file address in the code, you should be able to run it. See the comments in the code for details on calculations.
